# Prognostic score-based methods for estimating center effects based on survival probability: Application to post-kidney transplant survival

Youjin Lee, Peter P. Reese, and Douglas E. Schaubel

## Data


## Code

- `Code/aux.R` : provides auxiliary functions that estimate the variance of the weighted cumulative hazards and derive prognostic scores from a stratified additive hazards model.

- `Code/sim.R`: generates the simulated data and estimates the center effects using prognostic scores.

- `Code/realdata.R`:  reads the real data example and estimates the center effects using the proposed methods.

 

## Instructions for the use of sample data

In `Data/sample.csv`, we provide a hypothetical data with the same data structure as the real data presented in the paper. The data is provided for illustrative purpose only, not for reproducing the results.
