# Direct standardization method for evaluating center effects on survival outcomes

Youjin Lee and Douglas E. Schaubel

## Data


## Code

- `Code/aux.R` : provides auxiliary functions that estimate the variance of the weighted cumulative hazards and to derive a prognostic score from a stratified additive hazards model.

- `Code/sim.R`: generates the simulated data and estimates the center effects using the prognostic scores.

- `Code/realdata.R`:  reads the real data example and estimates the center effects using the proposed methods.

 

## Instructions for the use of sample data

In `Data/sample.csv`, we provide a hypothetical data with the same data structure as the real data presented in the paper. The data is provided for illustrative purpose only, not for reproducing the results.
